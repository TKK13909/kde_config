Adds space around windows touching a screen edge or other window.

The size of the gap and the layouts and applications to be gapped are configurable.

Please note this script does not do any automatic tiling. Its purpose is to reshape windows that have been manually positioned with the default KWin window management system.

[b]On old Plasma versions, additional steps may be required after installation to make the configuration menu available.[/b] For more information on installation, configuration and usage as well as any requests, please visit [url=https://github.com/nclarius/tile-gaps]the GitHub page[/url].
